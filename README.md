Audit & Compliance Data Analysis for Healthcare Platform
========================================================

📌 Overview
------------
This project focuses on analyzing healthcare compliance and audit data to assess regulatory adherence 
and financial trends in the healthcare sector. Using Tableau, we visualize key compliance metrics, 
reimbursement trends, and budget variances to provide actionable insights for decision-makers.

The dataset, sourced from CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services), includes healthcare plan 
ratings across different states, covering aspects such as:
- Overall Compliance Ratings
- Medical Care Performance
- Member Experience & Satisfaction
- Plan Administration Quality

📊 Key Features
---------------
🔹 State-wise Compliance Ratings: Analyzes average compliance scores per state.  
🔹 Plan Type Comparison: Compares PPO, HMO, and other health plan types based on performance metrics.  
🔹 Rating Breakdown: Evaluates medical care, member experience, and administrative performance.  
🔹 Interactive Tableau Dashboard: Enables data-driven decision-making through visual exploration.  

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
------------------------
- Tableau – Interactive data visualization  
- Python (Pandas) – Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- CSV Dataset – Healthcare compliance ratings  

📂 Dataset Details
